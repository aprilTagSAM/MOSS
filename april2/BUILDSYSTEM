Each package exports a number of symbols:

   * CFLAGS_X should be "whatever needs to be passed to the compiler
in order to successfully build package Y". It is usually a list of -I
options.

   * LDFLAGS_X should be "whatever needs to be passed to the linker in
order to successfully build package Y". It is usually a list of -L and
-l options, and a list of libraries.

   * DEP_X -- Is used to force relinking of a package if _X has been
modified. It is closely related to LDFLAGS_X, but contains only
library paths that should trigger linking (and does not contain other
linker options.)

For "leaf" packages (i.e., an actual program), you probably don't need
to export anything.

Rules.mk
------------------

The Rules.mk file is part of the "package-level" build system. In this
file, you:

      1. Pick a package name, by convention all lowercase (with underscores).
      	 We will assume 'foo_bar'.

      2. Define CFLAGS_FOO_BAR, LDFLAGS_FOO_BAR, and
      	 DEPS_FOO_BAR. These are for use by people who have a
      	 dependence ON your package, not for use in building your
      	 package.

      3. Define phony targets "foo_bar" and "foo_bar_clean". Add these targets to
      	 the system-wide 'all' and clean' rules: e.g.:

	 .phony foo_bar foo_bar_clean

	 all: foo_bar
               <---- NOTE: do not include any action here!

	 clean: foo_bar_clean
               <---- NOTE: do not include any action here!

      4. For foo_bar, foo_bar_clean, simply invoke 'make' on the
      appropriate Build.mk

      5. Recursively include any sub-packages' Rules.mk files.

------------------
Build.mk
------------------

This is where you build your actual package. It will be invoked with
knowledge of every package's CFLAGS_X, LDFLAGS_X, and DEPS_X
variables.
